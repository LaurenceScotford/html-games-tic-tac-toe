# html-games-tic-tac-toe
A responsive version of Tic Tac Toe (AKA Noughts and Crosses) with optional AI players

This is a work in progress project

Open in a browser to start a game. Currently two human players can play against each other. To play, take turns to enter the number of the cell where you want to make your mark.

The game will end when a win or draw condition is detected. At that point a new game can be started.

TO DO:

- Add in AI player
- Pretty up the user interface

Open in a browser to start a game. The game can be played by two human players, one human and one computer player or two computer players. The computer player has five strengths. To play with another person, take turns to enter the number of the cell where you want to make your mark. To play with a computer, you enter the number of the cell to make your mark, then the computer will play its move immediately.

The game will end when a win or draw condition is detected. At that point a new game can be started.
